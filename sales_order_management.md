# Sales Order Management

## Sales Order Types

1. **Standard Sales Order:**
   - A standard sales order is the most common type of sales order, where a customer purchases goods or services at the listed prices.

2. **Drop Ship Sales Order:**
   - In a drop ship sales order, the ordered items are shipped directly from the supplier to the customer without passing through your inventory. This is useful when you don't stock the items yourself.

3. **Special Order:**
   - A special order allows customers to request items that are not normally stocked or are custom-made. These orders may require additional processing or production time.

4. **Backorder Sales Order:**
   - A backorder sales order is created when the requested items are currently out of stock but will be shipped once they become available.

5. **Blanket Sales Order:**
   - A blanket sales order is used for recurring or periodic orders where goods or services are delivered in multiple shipments over a specified period.

6. **Service Sales Order:**
   - Service sales orders are used when selling services rather than physical products. These orders may include billing for professional services, consulting, maintenance, etc.

7. **Prepaid Sales Order:**
   - In a prepaid sales order, customers pay for the goods or services upfront before they are delivered or rendered.

## Order Processing Workflow

1. **Create Sales Order:**
   - Initially, you create a sales order to record the sale of goods or services to a customer. This order contains details such as item quantities, prices, shipping information, etc.

2. **Generate Invoice:**
   - Once the goods or services are delivered or rendered, you can generate an invoice based on the sales order. The invoice captures the amount owed by the customer for the products or services purchased.

3. **Invoice Status:**
   - After the invoice is generated, it will have a status indicating whether it has been fully paid, partially paid, or remains unpaid.

4. **Payment Application:**
   - When the customer makes a payment, you can apply the payment to the invoice in NetSuite to mark it as paid.

5. **Handling Invoiced Orders:**
   - In NetSuite, you can easily search for and view invoiced orders using saved searches or reports. You can filter by criteria such as customer, invoice status, date range, etc., to retrieve the desired orders.

6. **Reporting and Analysis:**
   - NetSuite provides various reporting and analysis tools that allow you to track invoiced orders, monitor payment status, analyze sales performance, and more.

7. **Integration and Automation:**
   - You can integrate NetSuite with other systems or applications to automate the invoicing process, streamline order management, and improve overall efficiency.
